ok so if you all build boats

you need to show people the rules and regulations of mooring wherever. because
a)why would i go to a marina
b) i love being in random places because you can look at the sky and meet new people
c)it lets everyone be spontaneous and learn about physics when they moor in strange places


learn by experience!

but think cheap, because everyone needs cheap solutions.
